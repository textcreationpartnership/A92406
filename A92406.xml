            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

On the 28. of Febr. with 15. Regiments of Foote, and 6. Regiments of Horſe, we paſſed the River Tyne at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Fordes near Bywell and Oringham, which if wee had not done that day, the ſudden alteration of the weather had made it for ſome time impoſſible to us, leaving behind 5. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Foot, and ſome Troops of Horſe, under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sir <hi>Iames Lumſdaine,</hi> Generall Major of the Forces on the other ſide Tyne: After we had paſſed Tyne, we found the River of Darwen ſo high by the ſudden thaw, that onely half of the Armie could paſſe it on Thurſday, the other part being forced to ſtay till Friday, when they alſo paſſed over with the Carriages, and ſo we directed our March toward Sunderland, it being very neceſſary for ſupply of the Armie, and receiving Intelligence, that wee ſhould have that Haven

               <!-- PDF PAGE 76 -->ſecured, near which we came on Saturday night, March the ſecond: And reſting the Lords day, the Enemie croſſed the River and left it, ſo we entred on Munday without ſtriking one blow.</p>
            <p>In this March from Tine to Sunderland, notwithſtanding the many ſtraight and diſadvantagious paſſages (which were ſo narrow, that ſometimes the people were: conſtrained to march one by one, as in a ſtring: and if God had given our enemies hearts, we might either have beene cut in peeces, or ſtopped) but we found no oppoſition from the enemy, and ſcarcely obtained a ſight of them, onely a Body of Horſe appeared upon our Reare, at our paſſing over the River of Weare, at New-Bridge, but interrupted us not. We remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our Quarters on Munday and Tueſday, taking what care wee could for ſupply of Proviſions in this Enemies Countrey, for ſo we finde it, not receiving any intelligence or willing ſupply from them. But it is no wonder wee finde not many friends, when there are ſo few men, the whole Countrey being in Armes, either willingly or forcedly: ſo great a power hath the Cathedrall here. On Wedneſday the ſixth of March the Enemy having united their Forces, and received an acceſſion of ſtrength by Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> who brought 21. Troopes from Yorke-ſhire, and by 1500. Foote, from Cumberland, they drew their Forces to a place about two or three Miles to the Weſt of Sunderland, and ſhewed themſelves upon the top of Worme-Hill: This Army was accordingly drawne forth; and both lay at about half a miles diſtance, on Wedneſday night in the fields, on thurſday mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they were againe drawne up ſomething nearer, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſtill keeping to the advantage of his ground upon the Hill, ſo that notwithſtanding the nearneſſe of ſome part of both Armies, being not above a quarter of a Mile diſtant, we

               <!-- PDF PAGE 76 -->could not without very great diſadvantage engage this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in regard of the impaſſable Hedges and Ditches betwixt us, ſo that likewiſe after the Armies had faced each other that day, they remained in the fields that night alſo: on Friday morning ſome little Skirmiſhes there was, betwixt ſome ſmall parties of Horſe, wherein that little advantage that was, fell to us, taking ſome few Priſoners, by whom wee underſtood, that they had on Thurſday night drawne off their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and withdrawne their Foote, and left a full body of Horſe which faced us in the morning till about tenne of the Clocke, and then taking the advantage of a very thicke ſtorme of Snow, which laſted two or three houres, (and in as ſore a manner ſure as ever was ſeene) marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and this Army, through the ilneſſe of the weather and wayes, rendred uncapable of purſuing; they alſo having ſo great a ſtrength of horſe in the Reare, and we not ſupplied with Proviſions to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Friday night this Army returned to their Quarters. We ſince underſtand by good hands, that the Enemies lying in the field two nights, was almoſt as bad as a Battell to them, many of their Men and Horſe dying, but more running away.
